**Brave** is widely touted as a privacy-friendly Chromium browser, but we have a number of concerns with their business practices and future business model that would prevent us from recommending them. The Brave team [has publicly stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/cs8foq/update_delisting_brave/) they do not want to be associated with privacy-focused groups like PrivacyTools ([PrivacyTools PR #657](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/pull/657)), which causes us to believe the Brave team does not wish to be under too much scrutiny from the privacy community as they continue to develop their product ([Reddit discussion](http://archive.today/2020.05.13-035943/https://www.removeddit.com/r/brave_browser/comments/csapsy/brave_browser_is_being_delisted_from/exf6i0f/)).
