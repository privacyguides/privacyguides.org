  Shelter is an app that helps you leverage the Android work profile to isolate other apps.

  Shelter supports blocking contact search cross profiles and sharing files across profiles via the default file manager (DocumentsUI).

  Notes
  CalyxOS includes a device controller so we recommend using their built in work profile instead.
