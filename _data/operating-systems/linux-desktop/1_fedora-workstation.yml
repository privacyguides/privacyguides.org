  **Fedora Workstation** is our recommendation distribution for users new to Linux.

  It has a semi-[rolling release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release) cycle. While some packages like [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) are frozen until the next Fedora release, most packages (including the kernel), are updated frequently throughout the lifespan of the release. Each Fedora release is supported for one year, with a new version released every 6 months.

  Fedora generally adopts newer technologies before other distributions eg. [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org), and soon, [FS-Verity](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FsVerityRPM). These new technologies often come with improvements in security, privacy, and usability in general.
