  **DivestOS** is a [soft-fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)#Forking_of_free_and_open-source_software) of [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/).

  DivestOS inherits many [supported devices](https://divestos.org/index.php?page=devices&base=LineageOS) from LineageOS. It has signed builds, making it possible to have [verified boot](https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot) on some non-Pixel devices.

  DivestOS has automated kernel vulnerability ([CVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures)) [patching](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/cve_checker), fewer proprietary blobs, a custom [hosts](https://divested.dev/index.php?page=dnsbl) file, and [F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org) as the app store. It includes [UnifiedNlp](https://github.com/microg/UnifiedNlp) for network location and some hardening with [Mulch Webview](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mulch). Users can also select the [Bromite SystemWebView](https://www.bromite.org/system_web_view) in ⚙️ Settings → Developer options → Webview implementation. DivestOS also includes kernel patches from GrapheneOS and enables security features in [defconfig](https://github.com/Divested-Mobile/DivestOS-Build/blob/master/Scripts/Common/Functions.sh#L698).

  DivestOS 16.0, 17.1, and 18.1 implements GrapheneOS's [`INTERNET`](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/connecting) permission toggle and [hardened memory allocator](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc).

  #### Notes
  DivestOS firmware update [status](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/firmware-empty/-/blob/master/STATUS) varies across the devices it supports. For Pixel phones, we still recommend using GrapheneOS or CalyxOS. For other supported devices, DivestOS is a good alternative.

  Not all of the supported devices have [verified boot](https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot), and some perform it better than others.
