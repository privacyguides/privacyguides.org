  **DivestOS** is a [soft-fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)#Forking_of_free_and_open-source_software) of [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/).

  DivestOS inherits many [supported devices](https://divestos.org/index.php?page=devices&base=LineageOS) from LineageOS. It has signed builds, making it possible to have [verified boot](https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot) on some non-Pixel devices.

  DivestOS has automated kernel vulnerability ([CVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures)) [patching](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/cve_checker), fewer proprietary blobs, a custom [hosts](https://divested.dev/index.php?page=dnsbl) file, along with bundled [F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org) as the app store. It also includes [UnifedNlp](https://github.com/microg/UnifiedNlp) for network location and some hardening with [Mulch Webview](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mulch). DivestOS also includes kernel patches from GrapheneOS and enables security features in [defconfig](https://github.com/Divested-Mobile/DivestOS-Build/blob/master/Scripts/Common/Functions.sh#L698).

  DivestOS also inherits LineageOS's [iptables](https://reddit.com/comments/c4a6f7) network access feature. You can deny network access to an individual application by pressing and holding on the app's icon (App info → Data and Network → Uncheck "Network Access").

  DivestOS 16.0 and 17.1 has GrapheneOS's [hardened memory allocator](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc). There are plans to port this to DivestOS 18.1.

  #### Notes
  DivestOS firmware update [status](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/firmware-empty/-/blob/master/STATUS) varies across the devices it supports. For Pixel phones, we still recommend using GrapheneOS or CalyxOS. For other supported devices, DivestOS is a good alternative.

  Like CalyxOS's firewall, the network access toggle can also leak in [some](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues/android/-/issues/3228) situations.

  Not all of the supported devices have [verified boot](https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot) and some perform it better than others.
