  Tor Browser is the choice if you need anonymity. This browser provides you with access to the Tor Bridges and Tor Network, along with extensions that can be automatically configured to fit its three security levels - Standard, Safer and Safest. We recommend that you do not change any of Tor Browser's default configurations outside of the standard security levels.

  Extensions
  You should never install any additional extensions on Tor Browser, including the ones we suggest for Firefox. Browser extensions make you stand out from other Tor users and your browser easier to fingerprint.
