  **Safari** is the default browser in iOS. It includes [privacy features](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/browse-the-web-privately-iphb01fc3c85/15.0/ios/15.0) such as tracking protection, isolated private tabs, iCloud Private Relay to hide your IP address from trackers, and automatic https upgrade.

  These options can be found in *Privacy and Security* (⚙️ Settings → Safari → Privacy and Security).

  ##### **Cross-Site Tracking Prevention**
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;padding-left:0;">
    <li>Toggle On: <strong>Prevent Cross-Site Tracking</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  ##### **Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement**
  This is Apple's own implementation of private ad tracking. If you don't wish to participate, you can disable this feature.

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;padding-left:0;">
    <li>Toggle Off: <strong>Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  ##### **Apple Pay**
  If you do not use Apple Pay, you can toggle off the ability for websites to check for it.

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;padding-left:0;">
    <li>Toggle Off: <strong>Check for Apple Pay</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  ##### **Always-on Private Tabs**
  Open Safari and press the tabs button at the bottom right corner. In the bottom middle press the downward facing arrow.

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;padding-left:0;">
    <li>Select: <strong>Private</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  #### Sync
  The synchronization of data is [not](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303) end-to-end encrypted. Safari only encrypts Safari Bookmarks in transit and stores in an encrypted format. As the service is not end-to-end encrypted Apple may be able to decrypt and access bookmarks.

  #### Extensions
  We generally do not recommend installing [any extensions](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/inside-safari-extensions-malware-golden-key-user-data/) as they increase your browser's [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface); however, if you want content blocking, [AdGuard for Safari](/browsers/#additional-resources) might be useful to you.
