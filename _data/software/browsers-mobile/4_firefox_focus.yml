  <strong>Firefox</strong> Focus iOS includes <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-ios">Tracking Protection</a> which lets you select the blocklists ad trackers, analytic trackers, social trackers and other content tracking.

  Focus also destroys browsing history on quit automatically which is a good way of automatically clearing cookies and website data regularly which is helpful to prevent tracking.

  <h5><strong>Sanitizing on close</strong></h5>
  Focus sanitizies all data on close by default. Pressing on the <img alt="iOS Garbage Bin icon" width="16" height="16" src="/assets/img/browsers/ios-trash.svg"/> will immediately destroy all cookies and website data for the entire session.

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  Focus only lets you open one tab at a time.
