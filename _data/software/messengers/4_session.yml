description: |
  Session is an encrypted instant messenger that uses three random service nodes to route messages anonymously on the Oxen Network.

  Session allows for E2EE in one-to-one or closed rooms that allow up to 100 members.

  Open rooms have no restriction on the number of members, but anyone can join.

  Notes
  Session does not support forward secrecy. The key pair for each conversation is not rotated.

  Technical information
  Session was independently audited in 2020. The protocol is described in a whitepaper.
