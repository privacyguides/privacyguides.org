  **uBlock Origin** is a popular content blocker that could help you block ads, trackers, and fingerprinting scripts.

  We suggest enabling all of the [filter lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists) under the "Ads", "Privacy" and "Malware domains". The "Annoyances" and "Multipurpose" lists can also be enabled, but they may break some social media functions. The *AdGuard URL Tracking Protection* filter list makes extensions like CleanURLs and NeatURLs redundant.

  We also suggest adding the [Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt) list and any of the regional lists that might apply to your browsing habits. To add this list, place a checkmark next to Import under the Custom section near the bottom of the Filter lists pane (acessed by click on the 🛡️ icon → ⚙️ ). Paste the URL of the filter list above into the text area that appears below and click 
✔️ Apply changes.
  
  Additional filter lists do slow things down, so only apply the languages that you use. More info can be found on [uBlock Origin's documentation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists).

  uBlock Origin also has different [blocking modes](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode). The easy mode [might not](https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/) necessarily keep you safe from every tracker out there, whereas the more advanced modes let you control exactly what needs to run.
