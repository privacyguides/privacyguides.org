Use a **search engine** that doesn't build an advertising profile based on your searches.

## Recommended Providers

The recommendations here do not collect personally identifying information (PII) based on each service's privacy policy. There is **no guarantee** that these privacy policies are honored.

Consider using a [VPN](vpn.md) or [Tor](tor.md) if your threat model requires hiding your IP address from the search provider.

| Provider | Search Index | Tor Hidden Service | Logging / Privacy Policy | Country of Operation |

| [DuckDuckGo](#duckduckgo) | [Bing](https://help.duckduckgo.com/results/sources) | :material-check:{ .pg-green } | Anonymized[^2] | United States |

To serve [anonymous local results](https://search.brave.com/help/anonymous-local-results), IP addresses are temporarily processed, but are not retained.

### Brave Search

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Brave Search logo](assets/img/search-engines/brave-search.svg){ align=right }

**Brave Search** is a search engine developed by Brave. The index is optimized against Google Search and therefore may provide more contextually accurate results compared to other alternatives.

Brave Search includes unique features such as [Discussions](https://search.brave.com/help/discussions), which highlights conversation-focused results such as forum posts.

[:octicons-info-16:](https://search.brave.com/help){ .card-link title=Documentation}

</div>

Note that if you use Brave Search while logged in to a Premium account, it may make it easier for Brave to correlate queries with specific users.

We recommend you disable [Anonymous usage metrics](https://search.brave.com/help/usage-metrics) as it is enabled by default and can be disabled within settings.

### DuckDuckGo

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![DuckDuckGo logo](assets/img/search-engines/duckduckgo.svg){ align=right }

**DuckDuckGo** is one of the more mainstream private search engine options. Notable DuckDuckGo search features include [bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) and a variety of [instant answers](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/features/instant-answers-and-other-features). The search engine uses numerous [sources](https://help.duckduckgo.com/results/sources) other than Bing for instant answers and other non-primary results.

DuckDuckGo is the default search engine for the [Tor Browser](tor.md#tor-browser) and is one of the few available options on Appleâ€™s [Safari](mobile-browsers.md#safari-ios) browser.

[:octicons-info-16:](https://help.duckduckgo.com){ .card-link title=Documentation}

</div>

DuckDuckGo offers two [other versions](https://help.duckduckgo.com/features/non-javascript) of their search engine, both of which do not require JavaScript. These versions do lack features, however. These versions can also be used in conjunction with their Tor hidden address by appending [/lite](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/lite) or [/html](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/html) for the respective version.

### Startpage

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Startpage logo](assets/img/search-engines/startpage.svg#only-light){ align=right }
![Startpage logo](assets/img/search-engines/startpage-dark.svg#only-dark){ align=right }

**Startpage** is a private search engine. One of Startpage's unique features is the [Anonymous View](https://startpage.com/en/anonymous-view), which puts forth efforts to standardize user activity to make it more difficult to be uniquely identified. The feature can be useful for hiding [some](https://support.startpage.com/hc/articles/4455540212116-The-Anonymous-View-Proxy-technical-details) network and browser properties. Unlike the name suggests, the feature should not be relied upon for anonymity. If you are looking for anonymity, use the [Tor Browser](tor.md#tor-browser) instead.

[:octicons-info-16:](https://support.startpage.com/hc/categories/4481917470356-Startpage-Search-Engine){ .card-link title=Documentation}

</div>

Startpage's majority shareholder is System1 who is an adtech company. We don't believe that to be an issue as they have a distinctly separate [privacy policy](https://system1.com/terms/privacy-policy). The Privacy Guides team reached out to Startpage [back in 2020](https://blog.privacyguides.org/2020/05/03/relisting-startpage) to clear up any concerns with System1's sizeable investment into the service, and we were satisfied with the answers we received.

Startpage previously placed limitations on VPN and [Tor](tor.md) users, but they recently created an [official](https://support.startpage.com/hc/en-us/articles/24786602537364-Startpage-s-Tor-onion-service) Tor hidden service, and as of April 2024 we have no longer noticed extra roadblocks for Tor or [VPN](vpn.md) users.

## Metasearch Engines

A [metasearch engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine) aggregates the results of other search engines, such as the ones recommended above, while not storing any information itself.

### SearXNG

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![SearXNG logo](assets/img/search-engines/searxng.svg){ align=right }

**SearXNG** is an open-source, self-hostable, metasearch engine. It is an actively maintained fork of [SearX](https://github.com/searx/searx).

[:octicons-home-16: Homepage](https://searxng.org){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[:octicons-server-16:](https://searx.space){ .card-link title="Public Instances"}
[:octicons-code-16:](https://github.com/searxng/searxng){ .card-link title="Source Code" }

</div>

SearXNG is a proxy between you and the search engines it aggregates from. Your search queries will still be sent to the search engines that SearXNG gets its results from.

When self-hosting, it is important that you have other people using your instance so that the queries would blend in. You should be careful with where and how you are hosting SearXNG, as people looking up illegal content on your instance could draw unwanted attention from authorities.

When you are using a SearXNG instance, be sure to go read their privacy policy. Since SearXNG instances may be modified by their owners, they do not necessarily reflect their privacy policy. Some instances run as a Tor hidden service, which may grant some privacy as long as your search queries does not contain PII.

## Criteria

**Please note we are not affiliated with any of the projects we recommend.** In addition to [our standard criteria](about/criteria.md), we have developed a clear set of requirements to allow us to provide objective recommendations.
