Use a **map and navigation app** that doesn't build an advertising profile based on your searches and location history. Instead of using Google Maps, Apple Maps, or Waze, we recommend these privacy-respecting alternatives.

The recommendations here either do not collect any user data or at least do not collect personally identifying information (PII) based on each service's privacy policy. There is **no guarantee** that these privacy policies are honored.

## Organic Maps

**Organic Maps** is an open source, community-developed map display and satnav-style navigation app for walkers, drivers, and cyclists. The app offers worldwide offline maps based on OpenStreetMap data, and navigation with privacy â€” no location tracking, no data collection, and no ads. The app can be used completely offline.

Features include cycling routes, hiking trails and walking paths, turn-by-turn navigation with voice guidance, and public transport route planning (only available in supported regions and cities).

Please note that Organic Maps is a simple, basic app that lacks certain features many users might expect, such as satellite images, streetview images, and real-time traffic information.

## OsmAnd

**OsmAnd** is an offline map and navigation application based on OpenStreetMap, offering turn-by-turn navigation for walking, cycling, driving, as well as public transport. It is open-source and does not collect any user data.

Compared to Organic Maps, OsmAnd has more [features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmAnd#Features) but is also more complicated to use. One noteworthy feature is the ability to overlay or underlay external map data, such as satellite images from Microsoft or [traffic data](https://web.archive.org/web/20211203063453/http://themm.net/public/osmand_traffic) from Google, although the latter is ignored by the automatic route planning. OsmAnd also has an optional integration of streetview images provided by [Mapillary](https://mapillary.com).

## Criteria

**Please note we are not affiliated with any of the projects we recommend.** In addition to [our standard criteria](about/criteria.md), we have developed a clear set of requirements to allow us to provide objective recommendations. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing to use a project, and conduct your own research to ensure it's the right choice for you.

### Minimum Requirements

- Must not collect PII per their privacy policy.
- Must not require users to create an account with them.
- Must not require users to share location data. If the user opts in to sharing their location, this data must be anonymized.
- Must retain core functionality when offline and allow users to download maps for offline use.

### Best-Case

Our best-case criteria represents what we would like to see from the perfect project in this category. Our recommendations may not include any or all of this functionality, but those which do may rank higher than others on this page.

- Apps should be open source.
- Should have route planning for public transport.
- Should have real-time traffic information for route planning.
- Should support advanced features such as detailed shop/point of interest (POI) information and reviews, topographic maps, and satellite and streetview images.
