**Password managers** allow you to securely store and manage passwords and other credentials with the use of a master password.

[Introduction to Passwords :material-arrow-right-drop-circle:](./basics/passwords-overview.md)

<div class="admonition info" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>

Built-in password managers in software like browsers and operating systems are sometimes not as good as dedicated password manager software. The advantage of a built-in password manager is good integration with the software, but it can often be very simple and lack privacy and security features that standalone offerings have.

For example, the password manager in Microsoft Edge doesn't offer E2EE at all. Google's password manager has [optional](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/11350823) E2EE, and [Apple's](https://support.apple.com/HT202303) offers E2EE by default.

</div>

## Cloud-based

These password managers sync your passwords to a cloud server for easy accessibility from all your devices and safety against device loss.

### Bitwarden

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Bitwarden logo](assets/img/password-management/bitwarden.svg){ align=right }

**Bitwarden** is a free and open-source password and passkey manager. It aims to solve password management problems for individuals, teams, and business organizations. Bitwarden is among the best and safest solutions to store all of your logins and passwords while conveniently keeping them synced between all of your devices.

</div>

Bitwarden uses [PBKDF2](https://bitwarden.com/help/kdf-algorithms/#pbkdf2) as its key derivation function (KDF) algorithm by default. It also offers [Argon2](https://bitwarden.com/help/kdf-algorithms/#argon2id), which is more secure, as an alternative. You can change your account's KDF algorithm in the web vault.

- [x] Select **Settings > Security > Keys > KDF algorithm > Argon2id**

Bitwarden's server-side code is [open source](https://github.com/bitwarden/server), so if you don't want to use the Bitwarden cloud, you can easily host your own Bitwarden sync server.

**Vaultwarden** is an alternative implementation of Bitwarden's sync server written in Rust and compatible with official Bitwarden clients, perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the resource-heavy official service might not be ideal. If you are looking to self-host Bitwarden on your own server, you almost certainly want to use Vaultwarden over Bitwarden's official server code.

With the acquisition of SimpleLogin in April 2022, Proton has offered a "hide-my-email" feature that lets you create 10 aliases (free plan) or unlimited aliases (paid plans).

The Proton Pass mobile apps and browser extension underwent an audit performed by Cure53 throughout May and June 2023. The security analysis company concluded:

> Proton Pass apps and components leave a rather positive impression in terms of security.

All issues were addressed and fixed shortly after the [report](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbulfrlrz/images/v1707561557/wp-pme/Cure53-proton-pass-20230717/Cure53-proton-pass-20230717.pdf).

### 1Password

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![1Password logo](assets/img/password-management/1password.svg){ align=right }

**1Password** is a password manager with a strong focus on security and ease-of-use that allows you to store passwords, passkeys, credit cards, software licenses, and any other sensitive information in a secure digital vault.

Traditionally, 1Password has offered the best password manager user experience for people using macOS and iOS; however, it has now achieved feature parity across all platforms. 1Password's clients boast many features geared towards families and less technical people, such as an intuitive UI for ease of use and navigation, as well as advanced functionality. Notably, nearly every feature of 1Password is available within its native mobile or desktop clients.

Your 1Password vault is secured with both your master password and a randomized 34-character security key to encrypt your data on their servers. This security key adds a layer of protection to your data because your data is secured with high entropy regardless of your master password. Many other password manager solutions are entirely reliant on the strength of your master password to secure your data.

### Psono

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Psono logo](assets/img/password-management/psono.svg){ align=right }

**Psono** is a free and open-source password manager from Germany, with a focus on password management for teams. Psono supports secure sharing of passwords, files, bookmarks, and emails. All secrets are protected by a master password.
