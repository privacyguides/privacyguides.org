title: Operating Systems
---
We publish configuration guides for the major operating systems, because you can generally improve the amount of data that is collected about you on any option, especially if you use [privacy tools](../tools.md) like our recommended web browsers in place of native tools where appropriate. However, some operating systems will be more privacy-respecting inherently, and it will be much harder to achieve an equivalent level of privacy on other choices.

If you're starting from scratch, we strongly recommend [Linux](../desktop.md) on desktop and [Android](../android/index.md) on mobile. If you already use something else and aren't interested in switching, we hope you'll find these guides useful.
