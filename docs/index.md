## Why should I care?

> “I have nothing to hide. Why should I care about my privacy?”

Much like the right to interracial marriage, woman's suffrage, freedom of speech, and many others, our right to privacy hasn't always been upheld. In several dictatorships, it still isn't. Generations before ours fought for our right to privacy. ==Privacy is a human right, inherent to all of us,== that we are entitled to (without discrimination).

You shouldn't confuse privacy with secrecy. We know what happens in the bathroom, but you still close the door. That's because you want privacy, not secrecy. **Everyone** has something to protect. Privacy is something that makes us human.

## What should I do?

> First, you need to make a plan

Trying to protect all your data from everyone all the time is impractical, expensive, and exhausting. But don't worry! Security is a process, and, by thinking ahead, you can put together a plan that's right for you. Security isn't just about the *privacy tools* you use or the software you download. Rather, it begins by understanding the unique threats you face, and how you can mitigate them.

==This process of identifying threats and defining countermeasures is called **threat modeling**==, and it forms the basis of every good security and privacy plan.

## About Privacy Guides

![Privacy Guides logo](assets/brand/logos/png/square/pg-yellow.png){ align=right loading=lazy }

Established in 2021 due to the difficulty of finding unbiased reviewers in the VPN and privacy space, **Privacy Guides** is the most popular, trustworthy, non-profit website that provides information about protecting your *personal* data security and privacy. Our crowdsourced recommendations and reviews of **privacy tools** and our community dedicated to helping others set us apart from other blogs and content creators. The team behind this project has been researching privacy and security in the open-source space for over 5 years, originally with a now-defunct web resource that eventually became the *Privacy Guides* millions of readers trust.

*Our website is free of advertisements and not affiliated with any of the listed providers.*

As seen in **WIRED**, **Tweakers.net**, **The New York Times**, and many other publications as a reliable source for privacy and security knowledge.

## What are privacy tools?

We recommend a wide variety of **privacy tools** (a.k.a. *privacy apps*, *privacy utilities*, *privacy software*) spanning software and hardware that you can use to improve your privacy. Many of the tools we recommend are completely free to use and open-source software, while some are commercial services available for purchase. Switching from mainstream data-hungry software like Google Chrome and Windows to privacy-focused tools like [Brave](desktop-browsers.md#brave) and [Linux](desktop.md) can go a long way towards controlling the information you share with companies and others.

## Why does privacy matter?

In the modern age of digital data exploitation, your privacy has never been more critical, yet many believe it is already a lost cause. It is not. ==Your privacy is up for grabs, and you need to care about it.== Privacy is about power, and it is so important that this power ends up in the right hands.

Many people get the concepts of privacy, security, and anonymity confused. You'll see people criticize various products as "not private" when really they mean it doesn't provide anonymity, for example. On this website, we cover all three of these topics, but it is important you understand the difference between them, and when each one comes into play.
