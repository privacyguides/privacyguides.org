## We must fight for privacy rights collectively

Fighting to improve our privacy cannot *only* be a matter of individual protections.

When [regulations keep attacking](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/08/chat-control-must-be-stopped/) the tools and services we rely on to protect our personal information, when corporations [exploit our data](basics/common-threats.md/#surveillance-as-a-business-model) more aggressively every day, and when platforms exponentially [erode online pseudonymity](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/10/15/real-name-policies/), we must broaden our reach to fight for our rights.

For privacy to become a valued and respected human right, **we must work together to defend privacy rights as a community**.

This section will progressively grow with more tools to support the community in its privacy advocacy and activism effort. The Privacy Activist Toolbox is the first part of this new development.
