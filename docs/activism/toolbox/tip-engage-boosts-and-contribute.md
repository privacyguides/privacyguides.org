# Engage, Boost, and Contribute

Once you have the knowledge, motivation, and energy, it's time to act! Perhaps you've read all the tips here, or read all of Privacy Guides' [Knowledge Base](../../basics/why-privacy-matters.md) already! But you don't need to know that much about privacy to start contributing.

The most important part is that you care about privacy rights, and want to be part of the movement to defend them.

Here's what you can do to become a privacy activist:

## Be active! Participate and contribute!

Being a privacy activist means to actively take part in the movement with a mission to protect and improve fundamental privacy rights for everyone.

<p class="admonition-title toolbox-quote">We want to help redefine 'activist' to a term that can include anyone who wants to work collectively to create social change. You don't have to be an expert, and you don't have to spend every waking minute trying to do 'activism'. You just have to be a person who wants to create change with other people.</p>

There are many ways to actively engage in the privacy rights movement.

While there is a lot that can be accomplished by *anyone* interested in joining, try to think about how you can orient your activism around your strengths, skills, and interests. This will help with sustainability.

If you find one way doesn't really work for you, and you get tired or bored quickly, then find another way to contribute. There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. Find the ways that work best for you.

Perhaps you like to write, to draw, to record videos, or to build applications? Or maybe you prefer to engage with people directly, and become involved in the more social part of privacy advocacy? This can all be incredibly valuable contributions to the movement.

Ask yourself these questions:

- [ ] What do I enjoy doing that could also be useful to the cause?

- [ ] What are my interests? What do I want to learn more about?

- [ ] Which skills and social networks do I already have?

- [ ] How much time do I have to contribute each week?

- [ ] Who around me shares my privacy values and could be an ally?

## Things you can do to engage, boost, and contribute

Here are some ideas of things you can do to become a privacy activist in your community, and a valuable member of the privacy rights movement:

<div class="toolbox-bullet-list" markdown>

🚀&nbsp; [Spread the words of your allies.](tip-lift-your-allies-up.md) Repost social media campaigns from digital rights organizations you like, and write about it on your own platforms. Encourage people to participate if there is a call to action.

✍️&nbsp; Write about the privacy issues you care about. Inform the public with accurate information and effective ways of action to push back against invasive technologies and legislations. This can be through your social networks, personal blog, or even a book!

💪&nbsp; [Participate](tip-small-actions-matter.md) in the actions organized by others. Reply positively to social media posts related to privacy rights, repost the content of your allies, sign petitions, report violations, join an online forum, and contact your representatives about privacy rights in your region of the world.

🙅&nbsp; [Refuse](tip-refuse-to-participate.md) to participate in privacy-invasive requests, and refuse to use privacy-invasive technologies as much as doable for your situation. Sometimes doing nothing can be a powerful action. Try to prioritize your privacy principles over [convenience](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/06/07/selling-surveillance-as-convenience/), and report on your refusal experiences on social networks and with your local communities.

🙌&nbsp; [Join or build communities](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/) with people sharing your privacy values. Be a positive contributor and lift your allies up. [Support your privacy comrades](tip-support-your-privacy-comrades.md) and [ask for help](tip-take-time-to-rest.md) when you need it yourself. Look for nonprofit organizations [seeking volunteers](../../about/contributors.md).

💵&nbsp; [Contribute financially](../../about/donate.md) if you can. If you cannot afford to participate in time, consider donating money. There are many digital rights nonprofit organizations that could do *so much more* if only they had more funding. Offering financial support when you can is a meaningful way to contribute to the privacy rights movement.

📍&nbsp; Go to local meetups related to privacy and digital rights. Meet people who share your values in-person, and grow your network to find allies in your area.

✊&nbsp; Take part in digital rights protests that support causes and raise awareness on privacy issues you care about. Actively look online for events to join in your local privacy rights community.

💛&nbsp; Invite others to join you in the movement to defend privacy rights!
