# Be Mindful of Accessibility

![Colored banner with four icons on it, a toolbox, a hammer, a heart with a checkmark, and a wrench.](../images/banners/banner-toolbox-tip-accessibility.webp){align=top}

Accessibility is indispensable to inclusivity, and should always be a priority in our work. To make our privacy communities welcoming to all, accessibility cannot be an afterthought. We must integrate it in our practice from the start. This means making sure the languages, visuals, tools, and venues we use are accessible to as many people as possible.

Here's what you can do to improve accessibility for your privacy-related content and communities:

## Accessibility for all, in all the ways

For many people who don't need any specific accommodations, accessibility is often only thought about in terms of solutions to *mobility* impairments, such as for people requiring the use of a wheelchair. While this is indeed and important factor to consider, there are many other types of disabilities and accommodations we should be mindful of in our privacy work.

Considering how each part of our work could be accessed more easily by everyone is essential to grow our movement, and to diversify our privacy communities. Ethically, it's also just the right thing to do, and should be the norm everywhere.

### Visual, auditory, and other sensorial accessibility

Anytime you are using images, audio, or any other sensorial elements in your advocacy work, you should always make sure to follow best practices to ensure your content will be accessible to people with visual, auditory, or other sensorial impairments.

- [x] If you use images in your websites or social media posts, make sure to always add proper [alt text](https://abilitynet.org.uk/resources/digital-accessibility/five-golden-rules-compliant-alt-text) to describe the information the image represents. Keep in mind visitors that might be using a [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader).

- [x] When designing websites, posters, flyers, or zines, keep in mind [visual accessibility](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/accessibility-basics-designing-for-visual-impairment--cms-27634a) for people with blindness, low vision, color blindness, and other visual impairments.

- [x] Be careful to refrain from using designs and videos with [flashing lights](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Seizure_disorders), or display proper warning if you do. Flashing or flickering light effects, and even certain high-contrast static images, can trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.

- [x] If you use [audio material](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/abilities-barriers/auditory/) in your advocacy, try to include captions or transcripts in your content for people with auditory impairments. If you organize a larger event with speakers, try to see if you could hire a sign language interpreter.

- [x] Whenever you develop content or organize events, always be mindful of people with sensory impairments or [sensory sensitivities](https://accessforallllc.com/sensory-and-cognitive-accessibility/).

### Website accessibility

If you develop a website in your privacy work, make sure to follow the international standards for web accessibility. This is very important to ensure readers using assistive devices will be able to access your content, and that people with visual impairments will not struggle to access your content.

- [x] Get familiar with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [international Web standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/). These standards have been reviewed for accessibility support by the Accessible Platform Architectures ([APA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/apawg/)) Working Group.

- [x] Use a [web accessibility evaluation tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/) to verify that your web content meets accessibility guidelines, or otherwise make sure to follow the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.pivotalaccessibility.com/2024/11/how-to-perform-a-web-accessibility-audit-step-by-step-guide/) (WCAG).

- [x] If your organization can afford it, hire a [web accessibility consultant](https://accessibilityinnovations.com/blogs/web-accessibility-consultant/).

### Global accessibility

Whether you write a post, an article, or a whole website in English, keep in mind that your audience is likely global.

People from all around the world will be able to read or watch your English content, many who don't speak English as their first language. Don't assume that your audience is only coming from your own country or region. This is a good thing by the way. **The battle for privacy rights must be global now**.

- [x] Be careful not to use too many references that are unique to your own country or region. If you do, make sure to explain what it is for people from other regions.

- [x] When talking about issues related to politics, make sure to specify what governmental entities are, and explain any special rights your country has (don't just name them). That way, outsiders will be able to understand and support your cause as well, even if perhaps they aren't directly impacted by this issue at the moment.

- [x] Don't assume everyone knows all the popular internet acronyms such as DIY (Do It Yourself) or IIRC (If I Recall Correctly). These acronyms are very challenging for non-native English speakers. When using acronyms in your content, always explain the full expression in parentheses at least once, or simply use whole words instead.

- [x] When inviting people to an event, consider that people from other time zones might be reading your invitation. If your event is online, always specify the [time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/) for the announced time. If your event is in person, always specify the whole location with the country and region ([**do not just name the city**](https://www.roughmaps.com/destinations/20-places-around-the-world-that-share-the-same-name/22)).

### Physical accessibility

When organizing events and meetups in person, it's essential to keep in mind physical accessibility for people with mobility challenges of all kind. This includes accessibility around the venue, but also on the journey to the venue.

- [x] Ensure the venue you select is [accessible for people using wheelchairs](https://sites.augsburg.edu/events/policies/accessible-events/accessible-event-planning-guide/). Check that there is access to an elevator if it's on an upper floor, there are access ramps and automatic doors if required, and that doorways and hallways are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair.

- [x] Make certain that there will be enough comfortable seating for your guests, and that seating and eating areas will be accessible to guests using wheelchairs or other mobility aids.

- [x] Check that there are wheelchair-accessible bathrooms nearby.

- [x] Evaluate the accessibility of the transit options available to reach the venue you select, including specialized transits for people who are using wheelchairs, or other types of mobility aids. Publish a map of the transit accesses around your venue.

- [x] Research if your venue has access to parking and accessible parking spots. Publish this information with your invitation.

- [x] Verify the venue you select is accessible to people with visual or auditory impairments.  For example, check if elevators are marked with Braille or raised letters, and make sure that hosts are informed on how to communicate with guests who are deaf or hard of hearing.

### Health accessibility

In-person accessibility isn't just about mobility. Accessibility is also important to consider for a variety of health conditions, including people who are vulnerable to infectious diseases, or require other accommodations related to their health.

- [x] Designate a trained person responsible for accessibility, and share their contact information in advance. That way, people will be able to contact this person if they have any questions before or during the event.

- [x] Encourage your participants to wear a mask, and try to select a venue with adequate ventilation to minimize the risks for people who are [vulnerable to respiratory infections](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/superspreader-events). If food is served, try to select a venue with an area allowing to consume food outside.

- [x] Make sure to bring a few boxes of [protective face masks](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/do-masks-work) to your event that guests can use for free. That way, people who might be at risk in dense crowd can decide to wear a mask once they arrived, or if they forgot to bring their own.

- [x] Try to prepare an area in your venue, or near your venue, where people can rest comfortably in a [quiet space](https://eventwell.org/ensuring-inclusive-events-the-importance-of-supervising-quiet-spaces-for-neurodivergent-attendees-and-vulnerable-adults/), if they feel tired or overstimulated during the event.

- [x] Promote a [scent-free](https://www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca/resources/publications/environmental-sensitivities-and-scent-free-policies) environment to make your event welcoming to people who have scent allergies, environmental sensibilities, or other health conditions that can be affected by scents.

- [x] Provide training for hosts and event volunteers to make sure they are aware of available accommodations, and can give helpful information upon request.

### Dietary accessibility

If your event provides meals, snacks, or drinks, make sure to prepare well in-advance to consider the potential dietary restrictions of your guests.

- [x] List clearly what types of food and drinks with be served (or available) at the event.

- [x] Provide contact information for people to reach out in advance if they have special dietary requirements or requests that have not already been addressed.

- [x] Try to provide food and beverages that will cover a variety of dietary needs, such as vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, lactose-free, alcohol-free, or low-sugar options.

- [x] If you host a large event, consider keeping a few [EpiPens](https://greatergood.com/blogs/news/epinephrine-public-areas) available on site in your emergency kit, in case anyone experiences a dangerous allergic reaction.

- [x] Make sure guests will have access to free and clean water, especially if your event is scheduled during a heat wave.

- [x] Ensure there is a quiet and private room available for anyone who might be breastfeeding.

- [x] Provide all this information in advance with your invitation, so that guests can evaluate properly if the event is accessible to them.

### Safety accessibility

Safety is also an important aspect of accessibility. Everyone has a unique threat model, and, for a variety of reasons, some people might be at an elevated risk to their physical safety when going to and participating in an event in person.

- [x] Implement a [Code of Conduct](https://oshwa.org/resources/how-to-write-a-code-of-conduct/) for your event or community. Ensure there are clear channels to report bad behaviors, and that your Code of Conduct is enforced properly.

- [x] Verify that access to the bathrooms is safe and well lit at your venue.

- [x] Make sure the venue you select is safe to access by transits or cars, and that the nearest parking lot or bus stop is well lit if the event ends late at night.

- [x] If your venue is located in an area that might be more dangerous at night, consider setting up an [accompaniment service](https://www.concordia.ca/campus-life/security/services/safe-walk.html) with a set of volunteers offering to walk guests safely back to their bus stop, for example. Make this information known in advance.

- [x] Implement a clear [Photo Policy](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/infos/privacy.html#photo-policy) for your event, and forbid all nonconsensual photos. You can also provide "No Photos" or "Photos OK" stickers, buttons, or lanyards for guests upon arrival. That way, guests can explicitly opt out of being photographed at your event if they prefer not to. If your event hired an official photographer, make sure they are careful to never take photos that include people wearing these badges. Ideally, limit event photos to a minimum, and only take photos of people after asking for their explicit consent first.

### Financial accessibility

Another aspect of accessibility that is often overlooked is financial accessibility. Sadly, many people are unable to access certain events due to financial limitations, even if it would be very helpful to them to network and meet privacy advocacy peers. When you organize an event, be mindful of providing options to increase financial accessibility.

- [x] Try to keep your events free or partly free whenever possible, while remaining vigilant about accepting money from [financial sponsors](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#donations-event-sponsorships-and-other-revenues) that could be in contradiction with your privacy values.

- [x] Reserve a quantity of free tickets for people with more severe limitations.

- [x] Offer discounts for students or unemployed peers.

- [x] Create opportunities for part-time volunteering, where people can offer to help a little, then participate in the rest of the event for free.

- [x] Provide contact information for people who would like to request free or cheaper access, or discuss their unique situation with you.

### Beginners accessibility

[Welcoming beginners](tip-welcome-beginners.md) is crucial in all the work we do. To keep your content and events accessible to beginners, it's important to be mindful of the language you use, the ways you present content, and the places where you promote your events.

- [x] Always explain acronyms with whole words before only using the letters only.

- [x] Be careful when using jargon, try to be explicit and use simple words and analogies.

- [x] Beware of gatekeeping. Try to stay aware of newcomers that might be quiet or isolated from the group. [Be inclusive](tip-keep-your-posts-and-community-inclusive.md) and invite them to participate.

- [x] Specify that your event welcomes beginners.

- [x] Be mindful of advertising your event in places where potential newcomers might see it. Be careful about not inviting people only from places reaching out to people who are already part of the privacy community.
