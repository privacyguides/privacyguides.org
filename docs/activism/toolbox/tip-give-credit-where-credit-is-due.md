# Give Credit Where Credit Is Due

To succeed in our battle, we must support each other. A good way to accomplish this is to never forget to give credit where credit is due. When another advocate or organization says something you agree with, boost them up, spread their reach, and thank them publicly.

Here are a few ways you can help your allies feel seen and valued:

## Why crediting people and organization is important

Giving credit to the right person or organization isn't only the ethical thing to do, it's also a way to build alliances, to bring more people to the cause, and to retain the allies you already have.

When people feel valued, they are usually inclined to work harder. People are also more likely to stick around places where they feel seen and appreciated. This is incredibly important for our movement.

When giving credit to organizations, you are also making a whole team feel valued. **Organizations are made of people.** Caring about the people who work hard at your allied organizations is fundamental to build our movement.

## Ways to credit your allies in your advocacy work

<div class="toolbox-bullet-list" markdown>

💬&nbsp; Quote your allies' work in your own content and material. Make sure to always credit their name and link to their external resources when you do.

🔗&nbsp; Link to your allies' resources on your own platforms. Give them credit for their work, and encourage your own audience to consult your allies' material.

👍&nbsp; Support your allies publicly on social media. Repost their content to increase their reach. Post about them while tagging them, to encourage your circle to follow them as well. Reply to their posts thanking them for their hard work for the cause.

🙌&nbsp; Reach out to offer your help on their projects, whenever you have the resources to do so.

💛&nbsp; When working with a group, make sure that each contributor is publicly thanked for their work, whether it's paid or volunteer work. Make the members of your group feel recognized and valued individually.

😊&nbsp; Depending on the platforms you use, make sure to attribute the work of each contributor to the name they have agreed to share publicly. Ask first how they prefer to be credited, but do not forget to credit them.

🏆&nbsp; When there are opportunities to nominate your allies for a reward, make sure to add your vote to support them.
