To succeed in our battle, we must **support each other**. One good way to accomplish this is to never forget to give credit where credit is due. When another advocate or organization says something you agree with, boost them up, spread their reach, and thank them publicly.

Here are a few ways you can help your allies feel seen and valued:

## Why crediting people and organization is important

Giving credit to the right person or organization isn't only the ethical thing to do, it's also a way to **build alliances**, to bring more people to the cause, and to retain the allies you already have.

When people feel valued, they are usually inclined to work harder. People are also more likely to stick around places where they feel seen and appreciated. This is incredibly important for our movement.

When giving credit to organizations, you are also making a whole team feel valued. Organizations are made of people, after all. Caring about the people who work hard at your allied organizations is fundamental to build our movement.

- **Quote** your allies' work in your own content and material. Make sure to always credit their name and link to their external resources when you do.

- **Link** to your allies' resources on your own platforms. Give them credit for their work, and encourage your own audience to consult your allies' material.

- **Support** your allies publicly on social media. Repost their content to increase their reach. Post about them while tagging them, to encourage your circle to follow them as well. Reply to their posts thanking them for their hard work for the cause.

- **Reach out** to offer your help on their projects, whenever you have the resources to do so.

- **Thank** your allies publicly when working with a group, whether it's for paid or volunteer work. Make the members of your group feel recognized and valued individually.

- **Attribute** the work of each contributor to the name they have agreed to share publicly, depending on the platform you use. Ask first how they prefer to be credited, but do not forget to credit them.

- **Nominate** your allies for rewards/awards if the opportunity arises, and make sure to add your vote to support them.
