Through your privacy advocacy work, be careful to never collect or share the data of others without their prior explicit consent. It's crucial to protect your allies' data in all that you do, whether it's individual action, organizing an event, or leading an organization.

Here's what you can do to safeguard the data of your privacy comrades:

## Where we might collect and share the data of others

There are many ways we might collect the data of others in our daily advocacy, sometimes without even realizing it fully.

It's important to develop an awareness of the data we collect and share ourselves, and protect the data of others with the greatest care. Not only is this critical for [integrity](tip-stay-true-to-your-principles.md), but it's also fundamental to build and keep the trust of our allies. Which in return is essential to build and grow our movement.

Here are a some examples of other people's data we might collect or share in the context of our privacy advocacy work, whether intentionally or inadvertently:

## How to protect the data of others

Each time we collect data from others, we become its guardian. This isn't a small responsibility, and we should always treat the data of others as [toxic asset](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/data_is_a_toxic.html).

We should always only collect and keep what was obtained consensually, and what is strictly required for operations.

Regardless of the data we have to collect, we should always make sure to:

1. **Minimize** data collection by verifying that it is absolutely necessary for the task ([data minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_minimization)).

2. **Ask for consent** from the data subject *before* collecting any data, and make sure consent is explicit and informed.

3. **Protect** the collected data with adequate and proportional security measures, ideally using [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) every time this is possible.

4. If this data needs to be shared with a third-party or a service provider, obtain data subject's consent prior to sharing, and verify the third-party or service provider offers adequate protections and proper deletion mechanisms.

5. **Delete** the data as soon as it isn't needed anymore, and ensure deletion is done thoroughly.

### Some practices to normalize in our advocacy work

- [x] Asking for consent before sharing someone's information (legal name, location, contact information, photos, etc.).

- [x] Asking people what name and pronouns they want to be referred to publicly.

- [x] Asking people how (and if) they would like to be credited publicly.

- [x] Asking for permission before using the quote of someone else in our own work.

- [x] Asking for permission before publishing a screenshot of someone else's post.

- [x] Respecting people's choices to show their face publicly or not.

- [x] Asking for consent before taking photos at meetups or events.

- [x] Blurring the faces of strangers in crowd photos (especially for children).

- [x] Using consent badges for photo permission at event, or ideally forbidding taking nonconsensual photos entirely.

- [x] Warning people in advance when there are recording technologies on premise (such as smart speakers or other recording devices).

- [x] Not requiring guests to sign up for events. Making sure all the information is public, without requiring to provide any personal information in order to participate.
