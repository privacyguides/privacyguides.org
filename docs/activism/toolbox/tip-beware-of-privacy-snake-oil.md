In your privacy advocacy, it's essential to use and recommend tools that are reliable to protect privacy. For this, you need to investigate and remain highly skeptical of any dangerous or unproven marketing claims.

Here's how to evaluate privacy claims, and recommend tools that are trustworthy:

## Why is there so much privacy snake oil?

Regrettably, it's quite common to see businesses using privacy promises only as a marketing strategy to reassure understandingly concerned users. But many aren't genuinely doing the work to make these promises come true.

Many businesses want to have their cake and eat it too, by attracting users with false promises of privacy all the while exploiting their data for profit. Other times, failure to meet privacy promises simply comes from incompetence or negligence.

Misleadingly, or fraudulently, presenting a product, service, or organization as being responsible and trustworthy with data privacy when it isn't is called [privacy washing](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/08/20/privacy-washing-is-a-dirty-business/).

There are many things you can learn to become more resistant to privacy washing, and become better at using and recommending genuinely privacy-preserving technologies.

## How to spot privacy snake oil

Unless it comes from a professional privacy source you have a high degree of trust in, never trust any privacy claims at face value.

Here are some red flags you should always keep in mind when evaluating a privacy tool, service, or organization:

- [**Conflict of interest**](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#conflict-of-interest): Is the source telling you this product is trustworthy independent of the company or parent-company that owns this product?

- [**Biased reviews**](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#fake-reviews): Is the review recommending this product truly independent, or has it received sponsorship money? Was the review AI-generated?

- [**Meaningless attestations**](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#meaningless-privacy-compliance-badges): Are claims of privacy law compliance or trustworthiness supported by external sources, or do they only come from the organization itself?

- [**Buzzword language**](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#buzzword-language): Is the advertising and description of the product using a lot of privacy buzzwords like "military-grade encryption" or "AI-powered"?

- [**Unsupported claims**](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#checkbox-compliance-and-copy-paste-policies): Are the claims supported by documentation and detailed descriptions? It's not enough to write "end-to-end encrypted." This claim should be supported by a detailed account of *how* the data is end-to-end encrypted, and using which protocols and algorithms.

- [**Unrealistic claims**](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#unverifiable-and-unrealistic-promises): Are the privacy claims being made realistic? Nothing can be 100% private or 100% secure. A trustworthy product will give you reasonable warnings about its limitations.

- [**Lack of deletion process**](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#flawed-or-absent-process-for-data-deletion): Is this product or service offering a clear process to delete user's data upon request? How much and how quickly could you delete your data if you wanted to stop using this service tomorrow?

- [**Untested technologies**](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#new-and-untested-technologies): Has this technology been tested by experts before? Are there any external actors who have verified its claims?

- [**Bad reputation**](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/03/red-and-green-privacy-flags/#critics-from-experts): What are privacy and security experts saying about this product or organization? Was the product or organization subjected to multiple critics from privacy experts? Was the organization impacted by important data breaches?

## How to trust privacy tools and services

You should never trust a product, service, or organization at 100%. Additionally, your trust should always be revocable, and you should revoke it as soon as new information warrants it. Even privacy professional sources that you trust might not always be up-to-date.

Things can change quickly in the tech world, and we must all be prepared to revoke our trust and adapt quickly when required.

That being said, here are some green flags you can keep in mind when evaluating a privacy tool, service, or organization:
