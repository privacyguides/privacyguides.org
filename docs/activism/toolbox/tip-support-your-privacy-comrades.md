# Support Your Privacy Comrades

Fighting for better privacy rights, privacy tools, and privacy practices is a collective endeavor. You cannot do it alone. Anyone around you contributing is fighting the same battle by your side. This battle can be difficult and isolating at time. This is why it's critical to care for each other.

Here are things you can do to support your privacy comrades:

## Fighting for privacy rights can be isolating in unique ways

We live in a world of social connections. When we moved these connections online, we regrettably also gave power to large corporations to monitor and monetize our social relationships and communications.

Many privacy advocates will choose, rightly so, to [leave](tip-migrate-outside-of-the-surveillance-ecosystem.md) entirely those abusive platforms. Sadly, a side effect of this is often severed relationships with loved ones, who refuse to join us on better privacy-respectful environments. Many of us have lost friends when we quit Facebook, or refused to join a Discord server. Taking a stand for our privacy values can come at the cost of some painful social losses.

Moreover, fighting to protect privacy rights while reading about attacks on those rights every day in the news can be draining.

Most advocates have experienced moments of great discouragement, and feelings of helplessness while facing the magnitude of the task at hand. **Social support is a matter of survival to recharge and continue this long battle for human rights.**

This is why we must work to rebuild communities of our own. Supportive privacy communities that are [kind](tip-be-kind-to-people-but-be-relentless-with-institutions.md), [inclusive](tip-keep-your-posts-and-community-inclusive.md), and [accessible](tip-be-mindful-of-accessibility.md).

## Stay vigilant to spot signs of distress and fatigue

Whether you are participating in a [privacy-oriented forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/) or reading posts and replies of your privacy comrades on social media, pay attention to potential signs of distress.

Some people will periodically take time off from the internet to rest, which can be very healthy at time. But others might isolate from fatigue and discouragement. Keep your eyes open, and try to develop your compassion whenever you read comments that could be a clue someone is at the end of their rope, and in need of support.

## Help whenever you can

Here are a few things you can do to support your privacy comrades in times of need:

- [x] Work on strengthening your empathy skills, and demonstrate more compassion. This is a superpower to take care of your community.

- [x] Tell them you understand this is difficult, and that you are here to help if they need support.

- [x] Ask if they would like to talk more about their difficulties in private.

- [x] Offer your time to talk with them on a privacy-respectful chat, audio, or video call, if this is something you are comfortable doing.

- [x] Invite them to join your community or group of like-minded people, if you think they might be a good fit.

- [x] Organize a group or event to socialize with your privacy comrades regularly, offline or online, in a privacy-respectful way.

- [x] Depending on circumstances (and only if they might be open to it), refer them to a helpful resource in private. However, be careful not to fall into [the advice trap](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-questionologist/202103/how-guide-people-without-giving-advice), unless they specifically asked for advices.

- [x] Stay kind and do not take it personally if they refuse your help or disagree with your [*solicited* advice](https://www.verywellmind.com/whats-behind-different-types-of-unsolicited-advice-3144961). Let them know the door is always open to reach out to you whenever they might need help later.
