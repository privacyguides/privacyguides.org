# Lift Your Allies Up

At times, it might feel like the privacy community is niche and isolated. The battle for privacy rights is difficult, and its defenders are scattered and spread out all around the world. This is why it's essential that we support and uplift each other, every time we can.

Here's how you can lift your allies up, and help to grow the movement:

## Your allies share your goals

It's easy to get lost in our own niche advocacy, and lose track of what others in our community are working on. Nevertheless, if we want to [**build a movement**](tip-build-alliances-not-wars.md) (and to succeed, we must), we need all the help we can get, from every person and organization sharing our values.

- [x] Whenever you see an organization with a campaign compatible with your mission, lift them up!

- [x] Even if you are an organization yourself, lift them up too!

- [x] Even if you are also working on a similar project, lift them up with you!

It doesn't matter if you are working on something comparable yourself, or if perhaps you would have worded their work slightly differently.  As long as the message is aligned with your mission and values, **spread the words of your allies loud and far!**

By lifting each other up, we will broaden the reach of the message we share, and ultimately this serves our goals and our community too.

In privacy advocacy, we truly need to adopt the mindset: **The more the merrier.**

## Concrete ways to support and lift your allies up

There are infinite ways to lift your allies up. Here are some ideas to get you started, whether you are an independent advocate, a digital rights organization, or a privacy-focused business:

<div class="toolbox-bullet-list" markdown>

👍&nbsp; When an organization or business sharing you values starts a campaign, repost them on social media. Additionally, you can quote them or write about it yourself, while linking to their profile and campaign. Boost them up!

✍️&nbsp; If you are a writer, regularly link to material created by other trustworthy organizations and people sharing your values, while giving them credit.

💛&nbsp; When an individual creates material favorable to your organization or project, take the time to repost them and thank them. This is bringing more people to your cause, without any work on your side!

🤝&nbsp; Change your mindset from competition to collaboration. See your peers as people fighting by your side. Whenever they win, you win too. Congratulate them on their successes, and support them in times of need.

🙌&nbsp; When you see that your allies need help with an expertise you have, try to offer your time and resources if you can afford it.

✊&nbsp; When reaching out to your community, talk about your allies' work as well, and help people discover new resources. Everyone has different ways to absorb new information. Perhaps you can help others find resources that are more compatible with their needs, even if it's not your material. You are not losing a member when you refer people externally, you are winning, because you are contributing to grow the movement.
