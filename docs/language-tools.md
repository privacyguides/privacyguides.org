**LanguageTool** is a multilingual grammar, style and spell checker that supports more than 20 languages. The software is [self-hostable](https://dev.languagetool.org/http-server), and the extensions do not send your input text to their server.

LanguageTool offers integration with a variety of [office suites](https://languagetool.org/services#text_editors) and [email clients](https://languagetool.org/services#mail_clients).
