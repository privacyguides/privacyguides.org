Text inputted to grammar, spelling, and style checkers, as well as translation services, can contain sensitive information which may be stored on their servers for an indefinite amount of time and sold to third parties. The language tools listed on this page do not store your submitted text on a server and can be self-hosted and used offline for maximum control of your data.

## Translation Tools

### LibreTranslate

**LibreTranslate** is a free and open-source machine translation web interface and API server. It uses [Argos Translate](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate) models on the backend for translations.

You can use LibreTranslate through a number of public instances, with some that offer a [Tor](tor.md) onion service or an [I2P](alternative-networks.md#i2p-the-invisible-internet-project) eepsite. You can also host the software yourself for maximum control over the text submitted for translation.

We use a self-hosted instance of LibreTranslate to automatically translate posts on our [forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net) to multiple languages.

We use the VSCode extension in our GitHub repository configuration to find any grammar and spelling errors on our website and in our articles.
