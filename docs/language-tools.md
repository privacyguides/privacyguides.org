## LTeX for VS Code

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![LTeX logo](assets/img/language-tools/ltex-for-vscode.svg){ align=right }

**LTeX** is a multilingual grammar, style, and spell checker for VS Code (or VSCodium) that supports more than 20 languages. It uses the open-source [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org) spell checker on the backend to check against not just dictionary spelling, but thousands of grammar rules and stylistic errors.
