## Kodi

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Kodi logo](assets/img/media-players/kodi.svg){ align=right }

**Kodi** is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) client that can replace the interface of the likes of Smart TVs, it supports all variety of entertainment including TV (PVR), Music, Games, Videos (TV Shows, Movies) and Pictures. Kodi relies on content being stored locally or on the internet for things like Youtube or hardware to interface with things like TV (PVR) and you can use add-ons<sup>1.</sup> to extend the experience. Kodi is compatible with most operating systems and hardware, including Raspberry Pi, Linux, and Android, see the [requirements here](https://kodi.wiki/view/Supported_hardware) for running Kodi.

1. Kodi has an add-ons store to extend the out-of-the-box experience, but **keep in mind that add-ons are made by the community and the company itself, so be careful what you install,** luckily most software add-ons are also FOSS, meaning the code on them can be inspected, but in general be careful what you install, see the [addons site](https://kodi.tv/addons/) for more.

Also, we advise against using it for Apple devices (outside of MacOS) as it requires jailbreaking them and jailbreaking reduces the security of the device, we recommend you have a Linux or an Android device for it instead if possible.

<!--- ## VLC Media Player

![VLC logo](assets/img/media-players/vlc.png){ align=right }

**VLC Media Player** is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) media player. It supports audio and video types of entertainment including TV (PVR), music and videos. VLC also relies on content being stored locally or can stream or play from the variety of hardware capture cards including tuner cards and online or on the local network too. Finally, VLC is also fully cross-platform and also has [add-ons](https://addons.videolan.org/) to extend the experience like Kodi, the same caution applies above.
