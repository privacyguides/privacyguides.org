Privacy Guides has a small, remote team of privacy researchers and advocates working to further our mission of protecting free expression and promoting privacy-respecting technology. As a non-profit, we are expanding very slowly to ensure the project is sustainable in the long term. All of our team members are listed [here](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/u?group=team&order=solutions&period=all). Please consider [donating](donate.md) to support our cause.

We are occasionally looking for strong journalistic writers, product reviewers, and privacy experts to help us out, and any open positions will be posted below.
