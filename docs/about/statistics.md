We self-host [Umami](https://umami.is) to create a nice visualization of our traffic statistics, which are public at the link below.

With this process:

- Your information is never shared with a third-party, it stays on servers we control
- Your personal data is never saved, we only collect data in aggregate
- No client-side JavaScript is used

Because of these facts, keep in mind our statistics may be inaccurate. It is a useful tool to compare different dates with each other and analyze overall trends, but the actual numbers may be far off from reality. In other words they're *precise* statistics, but not *accurate* statistics.
