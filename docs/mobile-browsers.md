These are our currently recommended mobile web browsers and configurations for standard/non-anonymous internet browsing. If you need to browse the internet anonymously, you should use [Tor](tor.md) instead. In general, we recommend keeping extensions to a minimum; they have privileged access within your browser, require you to trust the developer, can make you [stand out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Browser_fingerprint), and [weaken](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions/c/0ei-UCHNm34/m/lDaXwQhzBAAJ) site isolation.

## Android

### Brave

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Brave logo](assets/img/browsers/brave.svg){ align=right }

**Brave Browser** includes a built-in content blocker and [privacy features](https://brave.com/privacy-features), many of which are enabled by default.

Brave is built upon the Chromium web browser project, so it should feel familiar and have minimal website compatibility issues.

#### Recommended Brave Configuration

Tor Browser is the only way to truly browse the internet anonymously. When you use Brave, we recommend changing the following settings to protect your privacy from certain parties, but all browsers other than the [Tor Browser](tor.md#tor-browser) will be traceable by *somebody* in some regard or another.

These options can be found in :material-menu: → **Settings** → **Brave Shields & privacy**

##### Shields

Brave includes some anti-fingerprinting measures in its [Shields](https://support.brave.com/hc/articles/360022973471-What-is-Shields) feature. We suggest configuring these options [globally](https://support.brave.com/hc/articles/360023646212-How-do-I-configure-global-and-site-specific-Shields-settings) across all pages that you visit.

##### Brave shields global defaults

Shields' options can be downgraded on a per-site basis as needed, but by default we recommend setting the following:

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- [x] Select **Aggressive** under **Block trackers & ads**

<details class="warning" markdown>
<summary>Use default filter lists</summary>

Brave allows you to select additional content filters within the internal `brave://adblock` page. We advise against using this feature; instead, keep the default filter lists. Using extra lists will make you stand out from other Brave users and may also increase attack surface if there is an exploit in Brave and a malicious rule is added to one of the lists you use.

</details>

- [x] Select **Upgrade connections to HTTPS**
- [x] Select **Always use secure connections**
- [x] (Optional) Select **Block Scripts** (1)
- [x] Select **Strict, may break sites** under **Block fingerprinting**

</div>

1. This option provides functionality similar to uBlock Origin's advanced [blocking modes](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode) or the [NoScript](https://noscript.net) extension.

##### Clear browsing data

- [x] Select **Clear data on exit**

##### Social Media Blocking

- [ ] Uncheck all social media components

##### Other privacy settings

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- [x] Select **Disable non-proxied UDP** under [WebRTC IP handling policy](https://support.brave.com/hc/articles/360017989132-How-do-I-change-my-Privacy-Settings#webrtc)
- [ ] Uncheck **Allow sites to check if you have payment methods saved**
- [ ] Uncheck **IPFS Gateway** (1)
- [x] Select **Close tabs on exit**
- [ ] Uncheck **Allow privacy-preserving product analytics (P3A)**
- [ ] Uncheck **Automatically send diagnostic reports**
- [ ] Uncheck **Automatically send daily usage ping to Brave**

</div>

1. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed filesystem. Unless you use the feature, disable it.

#### Brave Sync

[Brave Sync](https://support.brave.com/hc/articles/360059793111-Understanding-Brave-Sync) allows your browsing data (history, bookmarks, etc.) to be accessible on all your devices without requiring an account and protects it with E2EE.

### Mull

<div class="admonition danger" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>

Firefox (Gecko)-based browsers on Android [lack per-site process isolation](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565196), a powerful security feature that offers additional protection against a malicious website exploiting a security vulnerability. Missing this feature likely won't pose an issue for low-risk web browsers who keep their browser up-to-date, but those visiting higher-risk sites or at risk of targeted/0-day attacks should strongly consider a Chromium-based browser like [Brave](#brave) instead.

</div>

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Mull logo](assets/img/browsers/mull.svg){ align=right }

**Mull** is a privacy oriented and deblobbed Android browser based on Firefox. Compared to Firefox, it offers much greater fingerprinting protection out of the box, and disables JavaScript Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation for enhanced security. It also removes all proprietary elements from Firefox, such as replacing Google Play Services references.

[:octicons-code-16:](https://codeberg.org/divested-mobile/mull-fenix){ .card-link title="Source Code" }

<details class="downloads" markdown>
<summary>Downloads</summary>

- [:simple-fdroid: F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/)

</details>

</div>

Enable DivestOS's [F-Droid Repo](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/) to receive updates directly from the developer. Downloading Mull from the default F-Droid repo will mean your updates could be delayed by a few days or longer.

Mull enables many features upstreamed by the [Tor uplift project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Tor_Uplift) using preferences from [Arkenfox](desktop-browsers.md#arkenfox-advanced). Proprietary blobs are removed from Mozilla's code using the scripts developed for Fennec F-Droid.

#### Recommended Mull Configuration

We would suggest installing [uBlock Origin](browser-extensions.md#ublock-origin) as a content blocker if you want to block trackers within Mull.

Mull comes with privacy protecting settings configured by default. You might consider configuring the **Delete browsing data on quit** options in Mull's settings if you want to close all your open tabs when quitting the app automatically, or clear other data such as browsing history and cookies automatically.

## iOS

On iOS, any app that can browse the web is [restricted](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines) to using an Apple-provided [WebKit framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit), so there is little reason to use a third-party web browser.

### Safari

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Safari logo](assets/img/browsers/safari.svg){ align=right }

**Safari** is the default browser in iOS. It includes [privacy features](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/browse-the-web-privately-iphb01fc3c85/15.0/ios/15.0) such as [Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention), Privacy Report, isolated and ephemeral Private Browsing tabs, iCloud Private Relay, fingerprinting protection by randomizing and presenting a simplified version of the system configuration to websites so more devices look identical, and the ability to lock private tabs with your biometrics/PIN. It also allows you to separate your browsing with different profiles.

[:octicons-eye-16:](https://apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/safari){ .card-link title="Privacy Policy" }
[:octicons-info-16:](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/welcome/mac){ .card-link title=Documentation}

</details>

</div>

#### Recommended Safari Configuration

We would suggest installing [AdGuard](browser-extensions.md#adguard) as a content blocker if you want to block trackers within Safari.

The following privacy/security-related options can be found in the :gear: **Settings** app → **Safari**

##### Profiles

All of your cookies, history, and website data will be separate for each profile. You should use different profiles for different purposes e.g. Shopping, Work, or School.

##### Privacy & Security

- [x] Enable **Prevent Cross-Site Tracking**

    This enables WebKit's [Intelligent Tracking Protection](https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention/#intelligent-tracking-prevention-itp). The feature helps protect against unwanted tracking by using on-device machine learning to stop trackers. ITP protects against many common threats, but it does not block all tracking avenues because it is designed to not interfere with website usability.

- [x] Enable **Require Face ID to Unlock Private Browsing**

    This setting allows you to lock your private tabs behind biometrics/PIN when not in use.

##### Advanced → Privacy

The **Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection** setting will randomize certain values so that it's more difficult to fingerprint you:

- [x] Select **All Browsing** or **Private Browsing**

##### Privacy Report

Privacy Report provides a snapshot of cross-site trackers currently prevented from profiling you on the website you're visiting. It can also display a weekly report to show which trackers have been blocked over time.

Privacy Report is accessible via the Page Settings menu.

##### Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement

- [ ] Disable **Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement**

Ad click measurement has traditionally used tracking technology that infringes on user privacy. [Private Click Measurement](https://webkit.org/blog/11529/introducing-private-click-measurement-pcm) is a WebKit feature and proposed web standard aimed towards allowing advertisers to measure the effectiveness of web campaigns without compromising on user privacy.

The feature has little privacy concerns on its own, so while you can choose to leave it on, we consider the fact that it's automatically disabled in Private Browsing to be an indicator for disabling the feature.

##### Always-on Private Browsing

Open Safari and tap the Tabs button, located in the bottom right. Then, expand the Tab Groups list.

- [x] Select **Private**

Safari's Private Browsing mode offers additional privacy protections. Private Browsing uses a new [ephemeral](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionconfiguration/1410529-ephemeral) session for each tab, meaning tabs are isolated from one another. There are also other smaller privacy benefits with Private Browsing, such as not sending a webpage’s address to Apple when using Safari's translation feature.

Do note that Private Browsing does not save cookies and website data, so it won't be possible to remain signed into sites. This may be an inconvenience.

##### iCloud Sync

Synchronization of Safari History, Tab Groups, iCloud Tabs and saved passwords are E2EE. However, by default, bookmarks are [not](https://support.apple.com/HT202303). Apple can decrypt and access them in accordance with their [privacy policy](https://apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww).

You can enable E2EE for your Safari bookmarks and downloads by enabling [Advanced Data Protection](https://support.apple.com/HT212520). Go to your **Apple ID name → iCloud → Advanced Data Protection**.

- [x] Turn On **Advanced Data Protection**

If you use iCloud with Advanced Data Protection disabled, we also recommend checking to ensure Safari's default download location is set to locally on your device. This option can be found in :gear: **Settings** → **Safari** → **General** → **Downloads**.

## Criteria

**Please note we are not affiliated with any of the projects we recommend.** In addition to [our standard criteria](about/criteria.md), we have developed a clear set of requirements to allow us to provide objective recommendations. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing to use a project, and conduct your own research to ensure it's the right choice for you.

### Minimum Requirements

- Must support automatic updates.
- Must receive engine updates from upstream releases quickly.
- Must support content blocking.
- Any changes required to make the browser more privacy-respecting should not negatively impact user experience.
