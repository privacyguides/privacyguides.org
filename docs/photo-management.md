Most cloud photo management solutions like Google Photos, Flickr, and Amazon Photos don't secure your photos against being accessed by the cloud storage provider themselves. These options keep your personal photos private, while allowing you to share them only with family and trusted people.

## Criteria

**Please note we are not affiliated with any of the projects we recommend.** In addition to [our standard criteria](about/criteria.md), we have developed a clear set of requirements to allow us to provide objective recommendations. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing to use a project, and conduct your own research to ensure it's the right choice for you.

<div class="admonition example" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">This section is new</p>

We are working on establishing defined criteria for every section of our site, and this may be subject to change. If you have any questions about our criteria, please [ask on our forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/latest) and don't assume we didn't consider something when making our recommendations if it is not listed here. There are many factors considered and discussed when we recommend a project, and documenting every single one is a work-in-progress.

### Minimum Requirements

- Cloud-hosted providers must enforce end-to-end encryption.
- Must offer a free plan or trial period for testing.

- Must offer a web interface which supports basic file management functionality.
- Must allow for easy exports of all files/documents.
- Must use standard, audited encryption.

### Best Case
