[**Pastebins**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) are online services most commonly used to share large blocks of code in a convenient and efficient manner. The pastebins listed here employ client-side encryption and password protection for pasted content; both of these features prevent the website or server operator from reading or accessing the contents of any paste.
