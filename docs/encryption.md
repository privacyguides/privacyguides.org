VeraCrypt is a fork of the discontinued TrueCrypt project. According to its developers, security improvements have been implemented and issues raised by the initial TrueCrypt code audit have been addressed.

When encrypting with VeraCrypt, you have the option to select from different [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt#Encryption_scheme). We suggest you **only** select [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-512) and stick to the [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) block cipher.

Truecrypt has been [audited a number of times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Security_audits), and VeraCrypt has also been [audited separately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt#VeraCrypt_audit).

## Operating System Encryption

<small>Protects against the following threat(s):</small>

- [:material-target-account: Targeted Attacks](basics/common-threats.md#attacks-against-specific-individuals){ .pg-red }

Built-in OS encryption solutions generally leverage hardware security features such as a [secure cryptoprocessor](basics/hardware.md#tpmsecure-cryptoprocessor). Therefore, we recommend using the built-in encryption solutions for your operating system. For cross-platform encryption, we still recommend [cross-platform tools](#multi-platform) for additional flexibility and to avoid vendor lock-in.

### BitLocker

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![BitLocker logo](assets/img/encryption-software/bitlocker.png){ align=right }

**BitLocker** is the full volume encryption solution bundled with Microsoft Windows that uses the Trusted Platform Module ([TPM](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/how-windows-uses-the-tpm)) for hardware-based security.

[:octicons-info-16:](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/BitLocker/BitLocker-overview){ .card-link title="Documentation" }

</details>

</div>

BitLocker is [officially supported](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/turn-on-device-encryption-0c453637-bc88-5f74-5105-741561aae838) on the Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions of Windows. It can be enabled on Home editions provided that they meet the following prerequisites.

<details class="example" markdown>
<summary>Enabling BitLocker on Windows Home</summary>

To enable BitLocker on "Home" editions of Windows, you must have partitions formatted with a [GUID Partition Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table) and have a dedicated TPM (v1.2, 2.0+) module. You may need to [disable the non-Bitlocker "Device encryption" functionality](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/enabling-bitlocker-on-the-windows-11-home-edition/13303/5) (which is inferior because it sends your recovery key to Microsoft's servers) if it is enabled on your device already before following this guide.

1. Open a command prompt and check your drive's partition table format with the following command. You should see "**GPT**" listed under "Partition Style":

    ```powershell
    powershell Get-Disk
    ```

2. Run this command (in an admin command prompt) to check your TPM version. You should see `2.0` or `1.2` listed next to `SpecVersion`:

    ```powershell
    powershell Get-WmiObject -Namespace "root/cimv2/security/microsofttpm" -Class WIN32_tpm
    ```

3. Access [Advanced Startup Options](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode-b90e7808-80b5-a291-d4b8-1a1af602b617). You need to reboot while pressing the F8 key before Windows starts and go into the *command prompt* in **Troubleshoot** → **Advanced Options** → **Command Prompt**.
4. Login with your admin account and type this in the command prompt to start encryption:

    ```powershell
    manage-bde -on c: -used
    ```

5. Close the command prompt and continue booting to regular Windows.
6. Open an admin command prompt and run the following commands:

    ```powershell
    manage-bde c: -protectors -add -rp -tpm
    manage-bde -protectors -enable c:
    manage-bde -protectors -get c: > %UserProfile%\Desktop\BitLocker-Recovery-Key.txt
    ```

<div class="admonition tip" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>

Backup `BitLocker-Recovery-Key.txt` on your Desktop to a separate storage device. Loss of this recovery code may result in loss of data.

</div>

</details>

### FileVault

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![FileVault logo](assets/img/encryption-software/filevault.png){ align=right }

**FileVault** is the on-the-fly volume encryption solution built into macOS. FileVault takes advantage of the [hardware security capabilities](os/macos-overview.md#hardware-security) present on an Apple silicon SoC or T2 Security Chip.

[:octicons-info-16:](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/encrypt-mac-data-with-filevault-mh11785/mac){ .card-link title="Documentation" }

</details>

</div>

We advise against using your iCloud account for recovery; instead, you should securely store a local recovery key on a separate storage device.

### Linux Unified Key Setup

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![LUKS logo](assets/img/encryption-software/luks.png){ align=right }

**LUKS** is the default FDE method for Linux. It can be used to encrypt full volumes, partitions, or create encrypted containers.

</div>

<details class="example" markdown>
<summary>Creating and opening encrypted containers</summary>

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/path-to-file bs=1M count=1024 status=progress
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /path-to-file
```

#### Opening encrypted containers

We recommend opening containers and volumes with `udisksctl` as this uses [Polkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polkit). Most file managers, such as those included with popular desktop environments, can unlock encrypted files. Tools like [udiskie](https://github.com/coldfix/udiskie) can run in the system tray and provide a helpful user interface.

```bash
udisksctl loop-setup -f /path-to-file
udisksctl unlock -b /dev/loop0
```

</details>

<div class="admonition note" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Remember to back up volume headers</p>

We recommend you always [back up your LUKS headers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Backup_and_restore) in case of partial drive failure. This can be done with:

```bash
cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/device --header-backup-file /mnt/backup/file.img
```

</div>

## Command-line

## OpenPGP

<small>Protects against the following threat(s):</small>

- [:material-target-account: Targeted Attacks](basics/common-threats.md#attacks-against-specific-individuals){ .pg-red }
- [:material-bug-outline: Passive Attacks](basics/common-threats.md#security-and-privacy){ .pg-orange }
- [:material-server-network: Service Providers](basics/common-threats.md#privacy-from-service-providers){ .pg-teal }

OpenPGP is sometimes needed for specific tasks such as digitally signing and encrypting email. PGP has many features and is [complex](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html) as it has been around a long time. For tasks such as signing or encrypting files, we suggest the above options.

When encrypting with PGP, you have the option to configure different options in your `gpg.conf` file. We recommend staying with the standard options specified in the [GnuPG user FAQ](https://gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#new_user_gpg_conf).

<div class="admonition tip" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Use future defaults when generating a key</p>

When [generating keys](https://gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html) we suggest using the `future-default` command as this will instruct GnuPG use modern cryptography such as [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519#History) and [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to):

```bash
gpg --quick-gen-key alice@example.com future-default
```

</div>

### GNU Privacy Guard

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![GNU Privacy Guard logo](assets/img/encryption-software/gnupg.svg){ align=right }

**GnuPG** is a GPL-licensed alternative to the PGP suite of cryptographic software. GnuPG is compliant with [RFC 4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880), which is the current IETF specification of OpenPGP. The GnuPG project has been working on an [updated draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh) in an attempt to modernize OpenPGP. GnuPG is a part of the Free Software Foundation's GNU software project and has received major [funding](https://gnupg.org/blog/20220102-a-new-future-for-gnupg.html) from the German government.
