Cryptomator uses AES-256 encryption to encrypt both files and filenames. Cryptomator cannot encrypt metadata such as access, modification, and creation timestamps, nor the number and size of files and folders.

Cryptomator is free to use on all desktop platforms, as well as on iOS in "read only" mode. Cryptomator offers [paid](https://cryptomator.org/pricing) apps with full functionality on iOS and Android. The Android version can be purchased anonymously via [ProxyStore](https://cryptomator.org/coop/proxystore).

Some Cryptomator cryptographic libraries have been [audited](https://community.cryptomator.org/t/has-there-been-a-security-review-audit-of-cryptomator/44) by Cure53. The scope of the audited libraries includes: [cryptolib](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib), [cryptofs](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs), [siv-mode](https://github.com/cryptomator/siv-mode) and [cryptomator-objc-cryptor](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-objc-cryptor). The audit did not extend to [cryptolib-swift](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib-swift), which is a library used by Cryptomator for iOS.

Cryptomator's documentation details its intended [security target](https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/security/security-target), [security architecture](https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/security/architecture), and [best practices](https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/security/best-practices) for use in further detail.

### VeraCrypt (Disk)

</div>

VeraCrypt is a fork of the discontinued TrueCrypt project. According to its developers, security improvements have been implemented and issues raised by the initial TrueCrypt code audit have been addressed.

When encrypting with VeraCrypt, you have the option to select from different [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt#Encryption_scheme). We suggest you **only** select [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-512) and stick to the [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) block cipher.

TrueCrypt has been [audited a number of times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Security_audits), and VeraCrypt has also been [audited separately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeraCrypt#VeraCrypt_audit).

## Operating System Encryption

<small>Protects against the following threat(s):</small>

- [:material-target-account: Targeted Attacks](basics/common-threats.md#attacks-against-specific-individuals){ .pg-red }

Built-in OS encryption solutions generally leverage hardware security features such as a [secure cryptoprocessor](basics/hardware.md#tpmsecure-cryptoprocessor). Therefore, we recommend using the built-in encryption solutions for your operating system. For cross-platform encryption, we still recommend [cross-platform tools](#multi-platform) for additional flexibility and to avoid vendor lock-in.

<details class="warning" markdown>
<summary>Shut devices down when not in use.</summary>

Powering off your devices when not in use provides the best security as this minimizes the attack surface of your FDE method as no keys are available in memory.

</details>

### BitLocker

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![BitLocker logo](assets/img/encryption-software/bitlocker.png){ align=right }

**BitLocker** is the full volume encryption solution bundled with Microsoft Windows that uses the Trusted Platform Module ([TPM](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/how-windows-uses-the-tpm)) for hardware-based security. We recommend that you use Bitlocker with the [TPM+PIN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/faq#what-is-the-difference-between-a-tpm-owner-password--recovery-password--recovery-key--pin--enhanced-pin--and-startup-key) option and not just your regular password as [extraction is impossible](https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2021/01/understanding-bitlocker-tpm-protection) when you use an extra a pre-boot protector like the PIN. The PIN is rate limited and the TPM will panic and lock access to the encryption key either permanently or for a period of time if someone attempts to brute force access.

[:octicons-info-16:](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/BitLocker/BitLocker-overview){ .card-link title="Documentation" }

</details>

</div>

BitLocker is [officially supported](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bitlocker-overview-44c0c61c-989d-4a69-8822-b95cd49b1bbf) on the Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions of Windows. If you have Home edition we recommend you [upgrade to Pro](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/upgrade-windows-home-to-windows-pro-ef34d520-e73f-3198-c525-d1a218cc2818), which can be achieved without reinstalling Windows or losing your files. An alternative solution could be to use VeraCrypt's [system encryption](https://veracrypt.io/en/System%20Encryption.html) feature. VeraCrypt does not use the system's TPM chip and all encryption keys are stored in memory, leaving them [vulnerable to extraction](https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2021/06/breaking-veracrypt-obtaining-and-extracting-on-the-fly-encryption-keys) while the device is online and mounted. We also recommend if you're using Bitlocker to make sure you

### FileVault

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![FileVault logo](assets/img/encryption-software/filevault.png){ align=right }

**FileVault** is the on-the-fly volume encryption solution built into macOS. FileVault takes advantage of the [hardware security capabilities](os/macos-overview.md#hardware-security) present on an Apple Silicon SoC or T2 Security Chip.

[:octicons-info-16:](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/encrypt-mac-data-with-filevault-mh11785/mac){ .card-link title="Documentation" }

</div>

We advise against using your iCloud account for recovery; instead, you should securely store a local recovery key on a separate storage device.

### Linux Unified Key Setup

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![LUKS logo](assets/img/encryption-software/luks.png){ align=right }

**LUKS** is the default FDE method for Linux. It can be used to encrypt full volumes, partitions, or create encrypted containers.

<summary>Creating and opening encrypted containers</summary>

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/path-to-file bs=1M count=1024 status=progress
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /path-to-file
```

#### Opening encrypted containers

We recommend opening containers and volumes with `udisksctl` as this uses [Polkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polkit). Most file managers, such as those included with popular desktop environments, can unlock encrypted files. Tools like [udiskie](https://github.com/coldfix/udiskie) can run in the system tray and provide a helpful user interface.

```bash
udisksctl loop-setup -f /path-to-file
udisksctl unlock -b /dev/loop0
```

</details>

<div class="admonition note" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Remember to back up volume headers</p>

We recommend you always [back up your LUKS headers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Backup_and_restore) in case of partial drive failure. This can be done with:

```bash
cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/device --header-backup-file /mnt/backup/file.img
```

## OpenPGP

<small>Protects against the following threat(s):</small>

- [:material-target-account: Targeted Attacks](basics/common-threats.md#attacks-against-specific-individuals){ .pg-red }
- [:material-bug-outline: Passive Attacks](basics/common-threats.md#security-and-privacy){ .pg-orange }
- [:material-server-network: Service Providers](basics/common-threats.md#privacy-from-service-providers){ .pg-teal }

OpenPGP is sometimes needed for specific tasks such as digitally signing and encrypting email. PGP has many features and is [complex](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html) as it has been around a long time. For tasks such as signing or encrypting files, we suggest the above options.

When encrypting with PGP, you have the option to configure different options in your `gpg.conf` file. We recommend staying with the standard options specified in the [GnuPG user FAQ](https://gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#new_user_gpg_conf).

<div class="admonition tip" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Use future defaults when generating a key</p>

When [generating keys](https://gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html) we suggest using the `future-default` command as this will instruct GnuPG use modern cryptography such as [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519#History) and [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to):

```bash
gpg --quick-gen-key alice@example.com future-default
```

</div>

### GNU Privacy Guard

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![GNU Privacy Guard logo](assets/img/encryption-software/gnupg.svg){ align=right }

**GnuPG** is a GPL-licensed alternative to the PGP suite of cryptographic software. GnuPG is compliant with [RFC 4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880), which is the current IETF specification of OpenPGP. The GnuPG project has been working on an [updated draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh) in an attempt to modernize OpenPGP. GnuPG is a part of the Free Software Foundation's GNU software project and has received major [funding](https://gnupg.org/blog/20220102-a-new-future-for-gnupg.html) from the German government.
