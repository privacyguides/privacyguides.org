Sometimes services will try to force you to sign up for an account by blocking access to content with annoying popups. They might also break without JavaScript enabled. These frontends can allow you to circumvent these restrictions.

If you choose to self-host these frontends, it is important that you have other people using your instance as well in order for you to blend in. You should be careful with where and how you are hosting, as other peoples' usage will be linked to your hosting.

When you are using an instance run by someone else, make sure to read the privacy policy of that specific instance (if available). They can be modified by their owners and therefore may not reflect the default policy. Some instances have [Tor](tor.md) .onion addresses, which may grant some privacy as long as your search queries don't contain personally identifiable information.

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

The [Old Reddit](https://old.reddit.com) website doesn't require as much JavaScript as the new Reddit website does, but it has recently blocked access to IP addresses reserved for public VPNs. You can use Old Reddit in conjunction with the [Tor](tor.md) Onion that was [launched in October 2022](https://forum.torproject.org/t/reddit-onion-service-launch/5305) at [https://old.reddittorjg6rue252oqsxryoxengawnmo46qy4kyii5wtqnwfj4ooad.onion](https://old.reddittorjg6rue252oqsxryoxengawnmo46qy4kyii5wtqnwfj4ooad.onion).

## YouTube

**Note:** YouTube has gradually rolled out changes to its video player and API that have thwarted some of the methods used by third-party frontends for extracting YouTube data. If you experience reliability issues with one YouTube frontend, consider trying out another that uses a different extraction method.

<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>

Invidious does not proxy video streams by default. Videos watched through Invidious will still make direct connections to Google's servers (e.g. `googlevideo.com`); however, some instances support video proxying—simply enable *Proxy videos* within the instances' settings or add `&local=true` to the URL.
