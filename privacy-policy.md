## Who is Privacy Guides?

Privacy Guides is a community project currently under the stewardship of Aragon Ventures LLC, a Minnesota corporation, which develops this website and a number of privacy-friendly services alongside a number of active contributors. The current list of public team members [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/privacyguides/people). Aragon Ventures LLC operates internet services and handles the financials of this project.

In the future, Privacy Guides will be an independently operated non-profit organization.

## How does Privacy Guides collect data about me?

We collect data:

* When you browse a website, forum, or other Privacy Guides service.
* When you create an account on a Privacy Guides service.
* When you post, send private messages, or otherwise participate on a Privacy Guides service.

This data will be collected regardless of browser, device, or app used to access our services. We do not buy or otherwise receive data from data brokers.

## What data do you collect and why?

### We collect data about visits to our websites.

When you visit a Privacy Guides website or service, regardless of whether you have an account or not, the website may use cookies, server logs, and other methods to collect the following data:

* What pages you visit,
* Your anonymized IP address: We anonymize the last 3 bytes of your IP, e.g. 192.xxx.xxx.xxx.

We use this data to:

* Optimize websites and services, so that they are quick and easy to use,
* Diagnose and debug technical errors,
* Defend websites and services from abuse and technical attacks.

This data is processed under our [Legitimate Interest](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/legitimate-interests/when-can-we-rely-on-legitimate-interests/) to provide our services to you in a an efficient and secure manner and to ensure the legal compliance and proper administration of our business.

Raw data such as pages visited, anonymized visitor IPs, and visitor actions will be retained for 60 days. In special circumstances—such as extended investigations regarding a technical attack—we may preserve logged data for longer periods for analysis. We store aggregate statistics about use of the websites and services we host indefinitely, but those statistics do not include data identifiable to you personally.

### We collect account data.

On some websites and services we provide, many features may require an account. For example, on forum.privacytools.io an account is required to post and reply to topics.

To sign up for most accounts, we will collect a name, username, email, and password. In the event a website requires more information than just that data, that will be clearly marked and noted in a separate privacy statement, per-site.

We use your account data to identify you on the website, and to create pages specific to you, such as your profile page. We will also use your account data to publish a public profile for you on our services.

We use your email to:

* Notify you about posts and other activity on the websites or services.
* Reset your password and help keep your account secure.
* Contact you in special circumstances related to your account.
* Contact you about legal requests, such as DMCA takedown requests.

On some websites and services you may provide additional information for your account, such as a short biography, avatar, your location, or your birthday. We make that information available to everyone who can access the website or service in question. This information is not required to use any of our services, and can be erased at any time.

We will store your account data as long as your account remains open. After closing an account, we may retain some or all of your account data in the form of backups or archives for up to 90 days.

## Who is my data shared with?

When you use services provided by Privacy Guides your data is processed by Aragon Ventures LLC, in order to facilitate their hosting obligations.
