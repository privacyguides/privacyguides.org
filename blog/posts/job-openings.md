## Content Creator

We're seeking a passionate multimedia content creator to spearhead our video production efforts on YouTube and other platforms. This role will involve creating engaging and informative video content that for example simplifies several privacy concepts and offers practical tips for protecting personal information. The ideal candidate will have experience in video production (but this is not strictly required) and a commitment to making complex topics accessible to a wide audience.

This is your chance to enter the tech & educational content creation space, without worrying about sponsors and advertisers diluting your message. We have no commercial interests to interfere with your content, and no agenda beyond simply providing the best privacy information out there. If you're excited about using the power of video to educate and inspire, we want to hear from you!

Your work will help inform our community and foster critical discussions about digital rights and responsibilities.

Other tasks will be to research new subjects to cover, perform interviews, and conduct product and service reviews for our recommendations.
