# We've Joined the Open Collective Foundation 501(c)(3)

![Privacy Guides cover image](../assets/brand/images/png/cover.png)

[Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org) provides knowledge, recommendations, and services to protect you against global mass surveillance programs and encourage self-control of your data online. Our website is free of advertisements and is not affiliated with any listed providers, because we believe that our ability to recommend solutions without receiving financial kickbacks is incredibly important in remaining unbiased.<!-- more -->

However, we have always accepted and solicited financial contributions from our community. Running this network of websites and services for free to the public is a time-consuming and costly endeavor. We do it because we believe it is the right thing to do, not because we are looking to make a profit. Any contributions have been either used to pay our expenses or saved in a reserve for expansion or times of need.

Today we are building on our transparency efforts by joining OpenCollective, a platform which will allow us to accept contributions and create expenses completely transparently. We are being sponsored by a fiscal host, the Open Collective Foundation, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote access to educational resources like ours.

The Open Collective Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that is collecting these contributions on our behalf. Because of this, contributions to Privacy Guides through OpenCollective are **tax-deductible** for US taxpayers.

Your support of this project will help us keep our servers running and pay for other various expenses accrued by the team while developing this community platform. We do not operate Privacy Guides for personal profit, and all funds will be used to further our mission in one form or another.

Please consider contributing at [opencollective.com/privacyguides](https://opencollective.com/privacyguides) if you like what we do.
