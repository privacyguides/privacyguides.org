# Digital Provenance: Implications on Privacy

With the popularity of generative AI, it's becoming more and more difficult to [distinguish](https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/can-you-tell-ai-generated-people-real-ones) reality from fiction. Can this problem be solved using cryptography? What are the privacy implications of the currently proposed systems?<!--more-->

## The Problem

Can you tell which of these images are AI generated?

![Group of geese by some water](../assets/images/digital-provenance/geese3.jpeg)

Actually, they're all real. But the fact that you believed some of them were AI generated poses a problem: how can we tell where an image came from, if it was AI generated, whether it was edited?
