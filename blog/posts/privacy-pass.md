# Privacy Pass: The New Protocol for Private Authentication

Services that require authentication can correlate your activity on that service with your account, and that account is normally linked with payment information that could potential link back to your real identity. With the privacy pass protocol, it doesn't have to be that way.<!-- more -->

## The Problem

Services that don't require an account or payment to use are great; you can use them with Tor, clear your browser history, whatever you need to do to keep your activity private. 

But logging into an account completely invalidates all of that. As long as you're logged into an account with a service, all your previous and current activity can be linked together, along with any data you provided such as an email address, payment information, etc.
