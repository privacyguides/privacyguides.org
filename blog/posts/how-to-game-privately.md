# How to Game Privately

The video game industry was estimated to be worth about [298.98 billion USD](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market) in 2024. [205.1 million Americans](https://www.theesa.com/annual-esa-study-reveals-video-games-universal-appeal-across-generations/) play video games (there are over 342 million Americans). Needless to say, gaming is a regular part of many of our lives: we use games to socialize, to relax after a hard day at work, to challenge ourselves an refine our skills. It's fair to say that gaming is an essential part of many of our lives.

The first known instance of copy protection for software came about from none other than [Microsoft](https://www.filfre.net/2016/01/a-pirates-life-for-me-part-3-case-studies-in-copy-protection/) (who else) for their game *[Microsoft Adventure](https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/game/microsoft/adventure/)*, now playable in your browser.
