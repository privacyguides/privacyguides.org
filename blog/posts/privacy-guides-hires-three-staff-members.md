Weâ€™re excited to welcome Em (she/her), our new journalist, who will play an important role in taking our [articles](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/) to the next level. She will be focusing on creating in-depth, interesting posts that explore the most important topics in the world of online privacy, security, and digital rights. Em will also conduct interviews with experts in the industry, analyze reports and studies, and produce investigative news stories to keep our readers informed.

Her work focuses on raising awareness and informing the public and organizations on data privacy tools, practices, and regulations. She is a passionate writer and thorough investigator, continuously working on ways to improve adoption of better privacy practices, and regularly creating educational material to make protective tools accessible to the groups who need them most.*

*Em is also a human rights activist who deeply values inclusivity, diversity, accessibility, and software for the public good. In her free time, you can find Em on Mastodon sharing privacy tips or boosting photos of cats and moss.*
